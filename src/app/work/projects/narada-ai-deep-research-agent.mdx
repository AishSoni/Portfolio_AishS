## Overview

Narada AI Deep Research Agent is a comprehensive research companion that combines intelligent web search, local knowledge bases, and advanced AI orchestration. Built with privacy-first principles, it allows users to conduct deep research while maintaining full control over their data and infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **üîç Agentic Web Search**: Multi-layered search using Tavily API and Firecrawl for comprehensive coverage
- **ü§ñ Local LLM Support**: Full integration with Ollama for local LLMs and embedding models
- **üìö Local Knowledge Bases**: Powered by Qdrant vector database for document search and retrieval
- **üîß MCP Server Support**: Extensible architecture supporting Model Context Protocol servers
- **üì± Responsive UI**: Modern, clean interface built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
- **üîí Privacy-First**: All data processing can be done locally for maximum privacy
- **üß† Smart Query Decomposition**: Breaks complex queries into multiple focused searches
- **‚úÖ Answer Validation**: Verifies sources contain actual answers with 0.7+ confidence threshold

## Architecture & Technologies

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React and Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive UI
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes handling business logic and orchestration
- **External Integrations**: Tavily API, Firecrawl, Ollama, Qdrant, MCP servers
- **AI Models**: OpenAI GPT-4o for search planning and LangGraph for workflow orchestration
- **Vector Database**: Qdrant for semantic search and document retrieval
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose for easy deployment

## Challenges and Solutions

The main challenge was creating an intelligent research system that could decompose complex queries, validate answer quality, and maintain conversation context across sessions. The solution involved implementing a multi-agent orchestration system with smart retry logic and transparent source attribution.

Another significant challenge was ensuring privacy while maintaining powerful AI capabilities. This was solved by integrating Ollama for local LLM processing and providing options for fully local deployment.

## Impact & Results

- Successfully processes complex research queries with high accuracy
- Provides transparent source attribution for all facts and claims
- Enables privacy-conscious research with local LLM options
- Extensible architecture allows integration of additional tools and data sources
- Real-time progress tracking improves user experience during long research sessions

The project demonstrates advanced skills in AI orchestration, full-stack development, and privacy-preserving AI system design.
